### Previous knowledge / Competencies

As is stated in the course prerequisites on the [announcement web page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-courses), this course is intended for people already familiar with basic statistics and R. Participants must be comfortable with topics such as hypothesis testing, correlation and linear models, and must have a prior knowledge of the "R" language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Participants who have already followed the SIB course ["Introduction to statistics with R"](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20220207_STATR) or an equivalent course, and have used its content in practice should fit this prerequisite.

Before applying to this course, please self-assess your knowledge in stats and R to make sure this course is right for you. Here are 2 quizzes:
