“Beat the Blues” clinical trial
########################################################

This dataset was used as an example in Chapter 11 of “A Handbook of Statistical Analysis using R” by Brian S. Everitt and Torsten Hothorn.
The authors include this data set in their HSAUR package on CRAN.

# ------------------------------------------
The Background

“These data resulted from a clinical trial of an interactive multimedia program called ‘Beat the Blues’ designed to deliver cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) to depressed patients via a computer terminal. Full details are given here: Proudfoot et. al (2003), but in essence Beat the Blues 
is an interactive program using multimedia techniques, in particular video vignettes.”

“In a randomized controlled trial of the program, patients with depression recruited in primary care were randomized to either the Beating the Blues 
program or to”Treatment as Usual" (TAU). Patients randomized to the BEat the Blues also received pharmacology and/or general practice (GP) support 
and practical/social help,offered as part of treatment as usual, with the exception of any face-to-face counseling or psychological intervention. 
Patients allocated to TAU received whatever treatment their GP prescribed. The latter included, besides any medication, discussion of problems with GP, 
provisions of practical/social help, referral to a counselor, referral to a practice nurse, referral to mental health professionals, or further physical 
examination.

The Research Question

Net of other factors (use of antidepressants and length of the current episode), does the Beat-the-Blues program results in better depression 
trajectories over treatment as usual ?

The Data

The variables are as follows:

    drug did the patient take anti-depressant drugs (No or Yes)
    length the length of the current episode of depression, a factor with levels:
        “<6m” less than six months
        “>6m” more than six months
    treatment treatment group, a factor with levels:
        “TAU” treatment as usual
        “BtheB” Beat the Blues
    bdi.pre Beck Depression Inventory II, before treatment
    bdi.2m Beck Depression Inventory II, after 2 months
    bdi.4m Beck Depression Inventory II, after 4 months
    bdi.6m Beck Depression Inventory II, after 6 months
    bdi.8m Beck Depression Inventory II, after 8 months

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), created by Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, 
one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health 
professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.
